# SMS-Spam-Detection
This project showcases a powerful and efficient Spam Text Detection system built using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It's an essential tool for identifying and filtering out unwanted and potentially harmful messages. Whether you want to enhance your email security, streamline communication, or gain insights into text data, this project has you covered.

Key Features:

  NLP Magic: Leverage the incredible capabilities of NLP to analyze and classify text messages.

  Machine Learning Mastery: Utilize the Random Forest Classifier to predict if a text is spam or not.

  Text Preprocessing: Implement advanced text preprocessing techniques to prepare data for analysis.

  TF-IDF Transformation: Transform text data into numerical features using the TF-IDF vectorizer.

  Model Training: With preprocessed data and feature vectors prepared, the model is trained using a labeled SMS dataset. This phase entails fitting the Random Forest classifier to the 
  training data.

  Model Evaluation: The SMS spam detection model's efficacy is assessed through comprehensive evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The project presents a   
  detailed report on the model's performance in identifying SMS spam.
